# Movie-Recommender-System-tmdb-dataset
A simple and efficient Movie Recommender System built using Python and machine learning techniques. The project recommends movies based on user preferences using content-based filtering

Movie_Recommender.ipynb :- 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the full preprocessing pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and tag generation. It applies stemming and builds a cosine-similarity matrix to identify relationships between movies. All core ML logic for the recommender system is implemented here.


app.py :-
This Python file powers the web interface, allowing users to search for a movie and view similar recommendations with poster images. It loads the processed similarity model, handles user input, and displays results on a clean, interactive webpage.
